## Cookie API is a REST API written in ES (JS)
### How to use:
You need to have a mysql database as well as npm and node installed.
You need to have a database as well as an user with permissions to that database
(currently you need to create a table "persons" with the values id (auto_increment), name, age).
After cloning the repo you need to install the needed npm packages (`npm i`) and then start the server.js with node (`node server.js`).
After that, just follow the console output.
### What does it currently do?
It can create (PUT) edit (POST) show (GET) and remove (DELETE) persons from a database.
If you really want to know how it works and what you have to do to get it to do something, you have to read the source code.
